# Two Pointer

## When

1. Pointer in same direction
   1. To maintain a window (slide window)
   2. To swap element in array (in place)
   3. Fast-Slow pointer
2. Pointer in different direction
   1. To find match pair (the input should be sorted in this case or the order is useless)

## Issue

1. Two input arrays usually means the two pointers are used in differecnt array
2. Be careful of the index range when searching the pointer's next position by using `while`
