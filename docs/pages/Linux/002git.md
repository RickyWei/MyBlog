# Caching your GitHub credentials in Git
git config --global credential.helper wincred
```

## SETUP & INIT

``` sh
git init

git clone [url]
```

## STAGE & SNAPSHOT

``` sh
# show modified files in working directory, staged for your next commit
git status

# add a file as it looks now to your next commit (stage)
git add [file]

# unstage a file while retaining the changes in working directory
git reset [file]

# diff of what is changed but not staged
git diff

# diff of what is staged but not yet commited
git diff --staged

# commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot
git commit -m “[descriptive message]”
```

## BRANCH & MERGE

``` sh
# list your branches. a * will appear next to the currently active branch
git branch

# create a new branch at the current commit
git branch [branch-name]

# switch to another branch and check it out into your working directory
git checkout [branch-name]

# merge the specified branch’s history into the current one
git merge [branch]

# show all commits in the current branch’s history
git log
```

## INSPECT & COMPARE

``` sh
# show the commit history for the currently active branch
git log

# show the commits on branchA that are not on branchB
git log branchB..branchA

# show the commits that changed file, even across renames
git log --follow [file]

# show the diff of what is in branchA that is not in branchB
git diff branchB...branchA

# show any object in Git in human-readable format
git show [SHA]
```

## TRACKING PATH CHANGES

``` sh
# delete the file from project and stage the removal for commit
git rm [file]

# change an existing file path and stage the move
git mv [existing-path] [new-path]

# show all commit logs with indication of any paths that moved
git log --stat -M
```

## SHARE & UPDATE

``` sh
# add a git URL as an alias
git remote add [alias] [url]

# fetch down all the branches from that Git remote
git fetch [alias]

# merge a remote branch into your current branch to bring it up to date
git merge [alias]/[branch]

# Transmit local branch commits to the remote repository branch
git push [alias] [branch]

# fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch
git pull
```

## REWRITE HISTORY

``` sh
# apply any commits of current branch ahead of specified one
git rebase [branch]

# clear staging area, rewrite working tree from specified commit
git reset --hard [commit]
