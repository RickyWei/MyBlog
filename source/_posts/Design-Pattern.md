## The SOLID Design Principles

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
   - each class has only one responsibility, and therefore has only one reason to change
2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
   - a type is open for extension but closed for modification
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
   - if an interface takes an object of type Parent, it should equally take an object of type Child without anything breaking
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
   - split up interfaces so that implementors can pick and choose depending on their needs
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions
   - Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions
